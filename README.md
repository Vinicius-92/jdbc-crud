## Terminal CRUD application

A functional terminal application that implements the 4 operations of a CRUD (Create, retrieve, update and delete) of a 
simple Seller object containing only autoincrement ID, name and last name. Made using:

* Java
* JDBC
* MySql
* Docker

### What I've learned:

After some time studying API using only Java with Spring Boot, come back to the language's basics implementation was a 
challenging but very satisfactory experience, I've got a better grasp with DAO Factory design pattern, understanding how
to make a better use to its form and structure. During parallel studying I've learned the basics of Docker and start using
to manage MySql database in this project, the instructions and commands use are in the MD file in repository's root.

### To do:

* ~Implement to the seller class more attributes~ -> Done
* ~Create a new class to determine the sellers department data~ -> Done
* Implement search by name and department methods
